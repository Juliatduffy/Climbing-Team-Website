            <h3>THE COMP TEAM</h3>
            <p> The competition (comp) team is for intermediate-advanced climbers who are interested in competing in 
            <a class="purple-link" href="https://usaclimbing.org/compete/collegiate-series/" >USA Climbing</a> (USAC) Collegiate events. 
            It is strongly encouraged that comp team members attend team practice every week. Additionally, there will be several comp 
            team specific events that members are required to attend.Â This team is for those who aspire to compete at the Collegiate National Championships at the end of 
            the year. Membership in USA Climbing is required, and all comp team members are required to attend at least one local qualifying event. For more 
            information about the comp team, check out our comp team <a class="purple-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaEXotJZsiK4A4vtXlS2hmiW5otbcVkSrX_Q1NXLf4w/edit?usp=sharing">info sheet</a>.</p>
          
            <h3>PRICE BREAKDOWN</h3>
            <p>Comp team members must pay $150 total in team dues. Members must also have an active USAC 
            membership ($65/ year) to be eligible to compete. Each year, we give reimbursements 
            back to comp team members to help cover membership costs as well as some competition travel and housing expenses. 
            This money comes from our sponsors and team fundraising efforts, so the amount we can provide may 
            vary annually. A further price breakdown of competition registration and USAC membership fees can be found 
            <a class="purple-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRS4XU2PpbYK2EL5dSBS6YNrrqmBcWPRqW0n3UQy2TxGZ_my8fbo2Bg2ntYrhcc4w/pub" 
            >here</a>. If you are interested in joining the comp team but have financial concerns, please reach out to us, and
            we can discuss available options.</p>
                
            <h3>WEEKLY COMP TEAM PRACTICE</h3>
            <p>Our team has a weekly practice that is exclusive to competition team members. Though this practice is not mandatory, attendance is strongly encouraged. These practices will be facilitated by <a class="purple-link" href="leadership.html">Gavin Albright</a>, with help from coaches  
            <a class="purple-link" href="leadership.html">Sophia Hoermann</a>, and <a class="purple-link" href="leadership.html">Soren Callo</a>. There will also be guest coaches helping out with practice on occassion. This Spring, comp team practice will be held every Thursday night and alternate between Momentum Millcreek from 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM and the Bouldering Project Salt Lake from 6:00 - 8:00 PM.</p>

            <h3>ADDITIONAL COACHING</h3>
            <p><a style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic; color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Extra Training Sessions:</a> In addition to our weekly competition team practices, team members are also encouraged to attend our rec team practices (see the <a class="purple-link" href="recteam.html">rec team page</a> for more details). 
            This Spring, we will also hold a monthly "TC day" where everyone on the comp team is invited to train at the USA 
            Climbing National Team Training Center.  Access to the TC costs $20/person per session. These sessions will be a great oppurtunity to train on competition style boulders similar to what you will see at competitions. In addition to these TC days, we also hold one larger comp team training camp per semester. This Spring, in April, we will be holding a two-day event at the Training Center. </p> 
            <p><a style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic; color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Personalized Coaching/ Training Plans:</a> 
            Starting this spring, we will be opening up a training plan application form where team members will have access to custom training plans. <a
            class="purple-link" href="leadership.html">Sophia Terrill,</a> club president, will writing these plans. If you want to see an example training plan of hers, we will have some
            stock training plans posted on the files page of our website. Feel free to follow these plans as they are or modify them to suit your needs. We also have an open, <a
            class="purple-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPoq80z-IvVHF6jbqix4pZOzg41t-JEWFQr_aDi_Io3MxdhA/viewform?usp=sharing">coaching
            consultation form</a> where you can ask climbing/ training questions. One of the coaches will get back to you within a week. You can choose to connect over text, a phone call, in person or on Zoom.
            </p>

            <h3>MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS</h3>
            <p> Comp team members will have access to all of the benefits (gym discounts, merch, practices, events, etc.) that are avaiable to those on the rec team. Additionally, comp team members will have access to special training events throughout the school year. Additionally, members will be provided with 
            jerseys and gear for competitions. Comp team members who qualify for the National Championships are guaranteed housing for the competition at a team Airbnb. Also, as stated above, 
            members will be eligible for competition travel/housing reimbursements throughout the season.
            In addition to all of these benefits, comp team members will also receive the bragging rights of being on the best collegiate climbing team in the country (Collegiate National Champions 2022, 2023 and 2024).</p>
            
            <h3>COMPETITION EVENT SCHEDULE</h3>

                      <strong>QE (Qualifying Events)</strong>
                      <p>From October to March, USA Climbing will host a series of local qualifying events that anyone with a USAC membership may attend. Participation in one or more of these events is enough to qualify for the CNQE series. Athletes may compete in a lead event or a bouldering event to qualify for both disciplines in the CNQE series. 
                          <a class="purple-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEXqx9JruffV3mJX6L67dF6Ii25k_1HcMXASZyYBeHM6Q-TEmwNnmgQXJUqHmIgw/pub" >Collegiate Qualification Event (QE) Guide</a> </p>

                      <strong>CNQE (Collegiate Nationals Qualifying Event)</strong>
                      <p>On March 29-30, and April 5-6, USAC will host CNQE events nationwide, with at least one event per division, where the top eight advanced and top five intermediate athletes in each discipline (bouldering and lead/top rope) will qualify for the Collegiate National Championships in May. Competitors may attend any CNQE, but registration is limited to one event per athlete. We encourage all of you to attend the event that is the most convenient for you (this could be a good excuse to visit home), but we will only guarantee travel/housing funding to athletes who compete in the CNQE within our division (the Rocky Mountain Division). Placing in a qualifying spot at a CNQE secures eligibility for all disciplines, including speed, which has open registration for Nationals.

                        national team athletes will have the opportunity to compete at the Collegiate World Championships.
