        <h3>THE COMP TEAM</h3>
          <p> &emsp; 
            The competition team is for intermediate-advanced climbers who are interested in competing in 
            <a href="https://usaclimbing.org/compete/collegiate-series/" style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">USA Climbing</a> (USAC) Collegiate events. 
            It is strongly encouraged that competitive team members attend team practice every week. Additionally, there will be several comp 
            team specific events that members are required to attend.Â This team is for those who aspire to compete at the Collegiate National Championships at the end of 
            the year. Membership in USA Climbing is required, and all comp team members are required to attend at least one local qualifying event.</p>
          
            <h3>PRICE BREAKDOWN</h3>
          <p> &emsp; Comp team members must pay an additional $100 in team dues at the beginning of the competition season. In addition to the $50 Rec Team fee, 
            that is $150 total. While this is a steep price, we have consistently worked as a team to receive funding from our sponsors and through school 
            organizations. Much of the money we receive is reimbursed back to comp team members to cover competition expenses. If you are serious about 
            wanting to compete, but cannot do so for financial reasons, reach out to us and we can see what options are available. A further 
            price breakdown of competition registration and USA Climbing membership fees can be found 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRBr4ZiTHgSn27Px-_QoUlQxij6G3vAFJghmYn4_p4tCEtEkNTaOo2OIVSJhUdiaQ/pub" style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">here</a>. </p>
          </p>

          <h3>MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp; Comp team members will have access to special training events throughout the school year. Additionally, members will be provided with 
            jerseys and gear for competitions. Comp team members who qualify for the National Championships are guaranteed housing for the competition at a team Airbnb. Also, as stated above, 
            members will be eligible for competition funding opportunities throughout the season.
          Most importantly though, comp team members get the bragging rights of being on the best team in the nation (Collegiate National Champions in 23' and 24').</p>
          
          <h3>EVENT SCHEDULE</h3>
            <p>&emsp; While exact dates for the 2024-2025 season have yet to be announced, there are three main events/series of events to look forward to:

                    <strong>QE (Qualifying Events)</strong>
                    <p>From October to March, USA Climbing will host a series of local qualifying events that anyone with a USAC membership may attend. Participation in one or more of these events is enough to qualify for the CNQE series. Athletes may compete in a lead event or a bouldering event to qualify for both disciplines in the CNQE series.

                    <strong>CNQE (Collegiate Nationals Qualifying Event)</strong>
                    <p>In April, USAC will host 10-15 CNQE events where the top five ranked athletes in each discipline (bouldering and lead) will earn qualification to the national championships in all three disciplines (bouldering, lead, and speed). These events are scattered throughout the country, and competitors may choose which event they would like to attend. All collegiate competitors with an active USAC membership are qualified to compete in the speed discipline at nationals.

                    <strong>Collegiate National Championships</strong>
                    <p>At the end of each season, (in May) the very best collegiate climbers from across the country compete at the National Championships. This is the biggest (and most fun) event of the year. The top 5 highest-ranked athletes per category qualify for the Collegiate National Team. Biannually, 
                      national team athletes will have the opportunity to compete at the Collegiate World Championships.

            <h3>HOW TO JOIN</h3>
             <p> &emsp;It is required that all competition team members first join the recreational team. The steps on how to do
              this can be found <a href="signup.html" style="color: rgb(139, 172, 255);">here</a>. Once the competition season starts, those interested 
              in comp team will then be asked to pay the additional fee for being on comp team. If you you have any questions, about this process or
              about the comp team in general, feel free to send us an <a href="contact.html" style="color: rgb(139, 172, 255);">email.</a>
