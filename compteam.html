        <h3>THE COMP TEAM</h3>
          <p> &emsp; 
            The competition team is for intermediate-advanced climbers who are interested in competing in 
            <a href="https://usaclimbing.org/compete/collegiate-series/" style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">USA Climbing</a> (USAC) Collegiate events. 
            It is strongly encouraged that competitive team members attend team practice every week. Additionally, there will be several comp 
            team specific events that members are required to attend.Â This team is for those who aspire to compete at the Collegiate National Championships at the end of 
            the year. Membership in USA Climbing is required, and all comp team members are required to attend at least one local qualifying event. For more 
          information about the comp team, check out our comp team <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaEXotJZsiK4A4vtXlS2hmiW5otbcVkSrX_Q1NXLf4w/edit?usp=sharing"  style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">info sheet</a></p>
          
            <h3>PRICE BREAKDOWN</h3>
          <p> &emsp; Comp team members must pay $100 in team dues at the beginning of the competition season. 
            In addition to the $50 Rec Team fee, that is $150 total. Members must also have an active a USAC 
            membership ($65/year) to be eligible to compete. Each year, we give reimbursements 
            back to comp team members to help cover this membership cost as well as some competition travel and housing expenses. 
            This money comes from our sponsors and team fundraising efforts, so the amount we can provide may 
            vary annually. A further price breakdown of competition registration and USAC membership fees can be found

            <br> &emsp;If you are interested in joining the comp team but have financial concerns, please reach out to us, and
             we can discuss available options.
          </p>

          <h3>MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp; Comp team members will have access to special training events throughout the school year. Additionally, members will be provided with 
            jerseys and gear for competitions. Comp team members who qualify for the National Championships are guaranteed housing for the competition at a team Airbnb. Also, as stated above, 
            members will be eligible for competition travel/housing reimbursements throughout the season.
          <br><br> &emsp; In addition to all of these benefits, comp team members will also receive the bragging rights of being on the best collegiate climbing team in the country (Collegiate National Champions in 2023 and 2024).</p>
          
          <h3>EVENT SCHEDULE</h3>
            <p>&emsp; While exact dates for the 2024-2025 season have yet to be announced, there are three main events/series of events to look forward to:

                    <strong>QE (Qualifying Events)</strong>
                    <p>From October to March, USA Climbing will host a series of local qualifying events that anyone with a USAC membership may attend. Participation in one or more of these events is enough to qualify for the CNQE series. Athletes may compete in a lead event or a bouldering event to qualify for both disciplines in the CNQE series.

                    <strong>CNQE (Collegiate Nationals Qualifying Event)</strong>
                    <p>In April, USAC will host 10-15 CNQE events where the top five ranked athletes in each discipline (bouldering and lead) will earn qualification to the national championships. These events are scattered throughout the country, and competitors may choose which event they would like to attend. We encourage University of Utah students to attend the event that is the most convenient for them (this could be a good excuse to visit home), but we will only guarantee travel/housing funding to competitors who compete in the CNQE within our division (the Rocky Mountain Division). Placing within the top five in one discipline at a CNQE qualifies you for both lead and bouldering at nationals. All collegiate competitors are automatically qualified to compete in speed at nationals.

                    <strong>Collegiate National Championships</strong>
                    <p>At the end of each season, (in May) the very best collegiate climbers from across the country compete at the National Championships. This is the biggest (and most fun) event of the year. The top 5 highest-ranked athletes per category qualify for the Collegiate National Team. Biannually, 
                      national team athletes will have the opportunity to compete at the Collegiate World Championships.
