          <h3>THE COMP TEAM</h3>
          <p> &emsp; 
            The competition team is for intermediate-advanced climbers who are interested in competing in 
            <a href="https://usaclimbing.org/compete/collegiate-series/" style="color: white;">USA Climbing</a> collegiate-level events. 
            It is strongly encouraged that competitive team members attend team practice every week. Additionally, there will be several comp 
            team specific events that members are required to attend.Â This team is for those who aspire to compete at the 
            <a href=" https://usaclimbing.org/collegiate-national-championships/" style="color: white;">Collegiate National Championships</a> at the end of 
            the year. Membership in USA Climbing is required, and all comp team members are required to attend at least one local qualifying event.</p>
          <h3>PRICE BREAKDOWN</h3>
          <p> &emsp; Comp team members must pay an additional $150 in team dues at the beginning of the competition season. In addition 
            to the $50 Rec Team fee, that is $200 total. While this is a steep price, we have consistently worked as a team to receive 
            funding from our sponsors and through school organizations. Much of the money we receive each year is reimbursed back to comp 
            team members directly. In 2024, we were able to provide $150 to everyone who opted into CNQE funding, and $300 to all 
            athletes who qualified for the World University Championships. In addition to these reimbursements, comp team members will be provided with jerseys 
            and gear (i.e. harnesses, chalk pots, bags), at no additional cost. Lastly, comp team members who qualify for the National Championships 
            are guaranteed housing at our team Airbnb.</p>
          <p> &emsp; We understand that competing is expensive, and we strive to make it as accessible as possible. If you are serious about 
            wanting to compete, but cannot do so for financial reasons, reach out to us and we can see what options are available. A further 
            price breakdown of competition registration and USA Climbing membership fees can be found
