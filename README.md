University of Utah Climbing Team Website
Welcome to the University of Utah Climbing Team website! This website is designed to provide students with information about our team, including our policies and procedures, 
what events/ oppotunities we offer each year, and of course, how to join. This was my first ever website, so I learned a lot in the process of building it. I used HTML, CSS,
to style the website, and Java to implement the interactive menu bar at the top of each page. 

Features
1. Interactive Menu Bar: The menu bar has several dynamic features that make this website feel more alive. When any link on the menu bar is hovered over, it is highlighted read. Clicking
on the link will take you to that section of the website. When the "Join" link is hovered over, a second, submenu appears with two options: "Rec team" and "Comp team".
2. Mobile friendly design: Several aspects of this website will change when the screen size is reduced. The menu bar collapses on mobile, and is hidden behind a hamburger icon
to save screen space. Some of the image aspect ratios and paragraph formats also change when screen size is reduced. These accomodations ensure that this website can be accessed by all devices,
and looks good regardless of screen size.
