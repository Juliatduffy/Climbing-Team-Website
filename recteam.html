            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
              The recreational climbing team is a climbing club/team for climbers of all skill
              levels, from complete beginners to experts.
              Our team holds a weekly practice, team
              outdoor trips, and special events
              throughout the school year. Additionally, members of the rec team
              will have access to big gym membership
              and gear discounts (see the price breakdown below for more
              details). If you have never tried climbing before
              but think you might like it, attending one of our rec team
              practices is a great place to start. The only
              prerequisite for joining the rec team is enthusiasm for climbing
              and meeting new people. It is required
              that all competitive team members are also on the rec team.
            </p>
            <h3>PRACTICES</h3>
            <div class="practices-content">
              <p> We hold a weekly practice that all rec and comp team members
                are
                invited,
                but not required to attend. That said, if you want to improve
                your climbing skills and make friends on the team,
                you should probably come! :) We have three experienced
                coaches,
                <a href="leadership.html">Sophia Hoermann</a>,
                <a href="leadership.html">Gavin Albright</a>, and
                <a href="leadership.html">Soren Callo</a> who
                organize structured
                practices each week. If you don't want
                to do the workouts that the coaches have planned, you do not
                have to. Everyone is encouraged to go their own pace. All skill
                levels are welcome.
              </p>
              <img src="images/TobiasPracticeBig.png" class="practices-photo">
            </div>

            <p> This Spring, our weekly rec team practice will be held on
              Wednesdays at Momentum Millcreek from 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM. Those
              who don't have
              a Momentum membership can sign up
              for a free practice day pass <a
                href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/8050549A9A92CA7F94-50984486-practice#/">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>ADDITIONAL COACHING</h3>

            <p> In addition to our weekly practices, we offer free,
              one-on-one coaching opportunities for those who are serious about
              improving their climbing.
              Starting this spring, we will be opening up a training plan
              application form where
              team members will have access to custom training plans. <a
                href="leadership.html">Sophia Terrill,</a> our team
              president, will
              be in charge of making these plans. If you want to see an example
              training plan of hers, we will have some
              stock training plans posted on the files page of our website soon
              <a
                style="font-style: italic; color:rgb(156, 224, 255); text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">(January
                2025)</a>.
              Feel free to follow these plans as they are or modify them to suit
              your needs. We also have an open, <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPoq80z-IvVHF6jbqix4pZOzg41t-JEWFQr_aDi_Io3MxdhA/viewform?usp=sharing">coaching
                consultation form</a> where you
              can ask climbing/ training questions. One of the coaches will get
              back to you within a week. You can choose to connect over
              text, a phone call, in person or on Zoom.

            <h3>OUTDOOR TRIPS</h3>
            <div class="outdoor-trips-content">
              <p>
                Throughout the school year, our team organizes outdoor
                climbing trips in nearby climbing areas. Utah and its
                surrounding states have a lot to offer, so whenever the
                weather is good we try and get after it! During longer breaks,
                such as fall and spring break, team funding may be used to
                book housing. During shorter trips, we will typically find
                a place to camp as a team. We will always do our best to
                carpool and make sure that everyone has a ride. These trips
                are subject to last-minute changes, as the weather can be
                unpredictable. The best way to stay up to date on these
                changes is through our team Discord. A tentative schedule for
                this year's outdoor trips can be found on this
                <a href="images/Outdoor-Trips.pdf">google doc</a>.
              </p>
              <img src="images/JessieMoe.png" class="outdoor-trip-photo">
            </div>

            <p>This year, the board members in charge of coordinating and running outdoor trips are <a href="leadership.html">Eli Budzinski</a>, <a href="leadership.html">Ayrie Dutt</a>, and <a href="leadership.html">Aidan Cooley</a>. Don't be afraid to reach out them if you have any questions!</p>
            <h3>LOCAL OUTDOOR DAYS</h3> 
            <p>
              <a style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(156, 224, 255); text-decoration: none;">New in Spring 2025: </a>
              In addition to our longer outdoor trips we host monthly
              local outdoor days. During these local days, we will be exploring
              areas within an hour from campus such as Little Cottonwood Canyon,
              Big Cottonwood Canyon, American Fork, Ogden, etc. Details will be posted in our newsletter, on Discord and on Instagram in advance of each trip.

            </p>

            <h3>PRICING BREAKDOWN</h3>
            <p>
              We ask that all team members pay <a style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(156, 224, 255); text-decoration: none;">$50</a> in team dues each year.
              This money stays within the club and is used to organize team
              events such as movie nights, park days, and outdoor climbing
              trips. Paying these dues is worthwhile if you plan on having a
              climbing
              gym membership in Salt Lake as you will likely save well over $50
              through
              our team discounts.
