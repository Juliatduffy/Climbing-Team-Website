          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The recreational climbing team is for climbers of all skill levels. The rec team is a perfect place for students to get outside, develop their climbing skills, and most importantly, to connect with other students in a meaningful way! Rec team members will have access to weekly team practices, special events, and big gym membership and gear discounts. The only prerequisite for joining the rec team is enthusiasm about climbing and meeting new people. Whether you are a complete beginner or an elite climber, you will be sure to find climbers of your ability level on this team. It is required that all competitive team members are also on the recreational team.
          </p>
          <h3>How To Join</h3>
             <p>
            Everyone is allowed to join our rec team, but we ask that all team members pay $50 in team dues each year. This money stays within the club and is used to organize team events such as movie nights, park days, and outdoor climbing trips. For outdoor trips, gas money and housing may be provided. Pro tip: If you plan on paying for a gym membership in Salt Lake this year, paying these team dues and joining our roster will save you ~ $300 a year in membership discounts.
