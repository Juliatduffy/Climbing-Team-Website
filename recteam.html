            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p> &emsp; 
            The recreational climbing team is for climbers of all skill levels, from complete beginners to experts. 
            Rec team members have access to weekly team practices, team outdoor trips, and special events 
            throughout the school year. Additionally, members of the rec team will have access to big gym membership 
            and gear discounts (see the price breakdown below for more details). If you have never tried climbing before 
            but think you might like it, attending one of our rec team practices is a great place to start. The only 
            prerequisite for joining the rec team is enthusiasm about climbing and meeting new people. It is required 
            that all competitive team members are also on the rec team.
          </p>
          <h3>PRACTICES</h3>
          <div class="practices-content">
          <p> &emsp; Our team holds a weekly practice at the Bouldering Project Salt Lake. All rec team members are invited, 
            but not required to attend. That said, if you want to improve your climbing skills and make friends on the team, 
            you should probably come! :) We currently have two experienced coaches, 
            <a href="leadership.html" style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">Sophia Hoermann</a> and 
            <a href="leadership.html" style="color: rgb(139, 172, 255);">Vasko Vassilev</a> working with our team. At practice, 
            feel free to ask them for training plans, workouts, or beta - they are really good at what they do! This fall, our weekly practices will be held on
            Wednesdays at Momentum Millcreek from 8-10pm. Those who don't have a Momentum membership can sign up
            for a free practice day pass <a style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);" href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/8050549A9A92CA7F94-50984486-practice#/">here</a>.</p>

          <h3>OUTDOOR TRIPS</h3>
          <div class="outdoor-trips-content">
            <p>
              &emsp; Throughout the school year, our team organizes outdoor climbing trips in nearby climbing areas. Utah and its 
              surrounding states have a lot to offer, so whenever the weather is good we try and get after it! During longer breaks, 
              such as fall and spring break, team funding may be used to book housing. During shorter trips, we will typically find 
              a place to camp as a team. We will always do our best to carpool and make sure that everyone has a ride. These trips 
              are subject to last-minute changes, as the weather can be unpredictable. The best way to stay up to date on these 
              changes is through our team Discord. A tentative schedule for this year's outdoor trips can be found on this 
              <a href="images/Outdoor-Trips.pdf" style="color:rgb(139, 172, 255);">google doc</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>PRICE BREAKDOWN</h3>
             <p> &emsp; 
            We ask that all team members pay $50 in team dues each year. This money stays within the club and is used to organize team 
            events such as movie nights, park days, and outdoor climbing trips. If you plan on paying for a gym membership in Salt Lake 
            this year, paying these team dues and joining our roster could save you up to $300 a year in membership discounts.
          </p>

          <p> &emsp; The steps on how to join rec team can be found <a href="signup.html" style="color: rgb(139, 172, 255);">here</a>. Once you join our roster, don't forget
            to follow us on our socials to stay up to date! If you have questions about this process,
