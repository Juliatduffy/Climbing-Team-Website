                <p>Hey everyone! My name is Sophia and I'm a senior studying
                  Kinesiology! I'm still exploring what I
                  want to do post grad but am currently psyched on PT! I'm
                  originally from Tacoma, WA and competed for
                  Vertical World Climbing Team in Seattle growing up. Now I'm
                  more
                  focused on outdoor climbing, and my favorite
                  places to climb are World Wall in North Bend Washington and
                  Little Cottonwood Canyon! Outside of climbing
                  I love cooking, reading, sewing, and doing anything outside!

                  <p>Hello! I’m Sophia and I’m a junior majoring in world
                    languages and cultures and computer science!
                    I’m from the SF bay area and I grew up competing in youth
                    competitions and climbing outside mainly
                    in Bishop and Tahoe. These days I love bouldering in Little
                    Cottonwood Canyon and anywhere else I
                    can get out to! Outside of climbing I’m really into
                    knitting,
                    crocheting, plants, jewelry making,
                    and cooking. I’m so excited to help coach the U team this
                    year!</p>

                  <p>Hi my name is Gavin. I am a sophomore studying Graphic
                    Design.
                    I am originally from Sun Prairie, WI and grew up climbing
                    for
                    Boulder’s and Adventure Rock Climbing Team and won youth
                    sport
                    nationals in 2021! I love climbing all places outside but if
                    I
                    had to choose a favorite I would pick Red Rocks. Outside of
                    climbing I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, mtg,
                    and doing lots of art including drawing, painting, and
                    photography.</p>
