                                        Before?</strong> - If you have never
                                    tried climbing before but think you might
                                    enjoy it, the recreational team
                                    is a great place to start. At
                                    team practice, newer climbers can climb
                                    together in an encouraging environment and
                                    learn the fundamentals of
                                    climbing. There are three coaches who work
                                    with our team who will be at each practice.
                                    Additionally,
                                    there are plenty of great climbers on
                                    team who would be sure to give you some
                                    pointers if you asked.
