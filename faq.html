                                <strong>What if I have never climbed before?</strong> - If you have never tried climbing before but think you might enjoy it, our Recreational Team 
                                is a great place to start. At our weekly team practices, new climbers can get together in a safe 
                                environment to learn the fundamentals of climbing. We have two experienced coaches who will be at 
                                practice to help with this. Additionally, there are plenty of great climbers on our 
                                team who would be sure to give you some pointers if you asked.
